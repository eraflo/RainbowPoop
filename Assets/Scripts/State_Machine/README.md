# State Machine

## State Manager

The State Manager is responsible for managing the different states within the game. It handles the transitions between states and ensures that the correct state logic is executed at the right time. The State Manager maintains a reference to the current state and provides methods to change states, update the current state, and handle state-specific behavior.

Key responsibilities of the State Manager include:
- Initializing and setting the initial state.
- Transitioning between states based on game events or conditions.
- Updating the current state during each game loop iteration.
- Delegating state-specific behavior to the active state.

The State Manager is a crucial component for implementing a robust and maintainable state machine in the game.

## State

A State represents a specific mode or behavior of the game. Each state encapsulates the logic and behavior that should be executed when the game is in that particular state. States are responsible for handling their own initialization, updates, and cleanup.

Key responsibilities of a State include:
- Initializing any necessary resources or variables when the state is entered.
- Updating the game logic specific to the state during each game loop iteration.
- Handling transitions to other states based on game events or conditions.
- Cleaning up resources or resetting variables when the state is exited.

States are designed to be modular and self-contained, making it easier to manage and extend the game's behavior by adding or modifying states.
